# Microsoft Sentinel Resources

This repository contains reusable content for Microsoft Sentinel, including:

- **KQL queries** for hunting, detections, and troubleshooting.
- **Analytics rules** for automating alerting and incident creation.
- **Workbooks** for visualizing security data and metrics.
