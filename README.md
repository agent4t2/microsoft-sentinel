# Microsoft Sentinel Resources

This repository contains reusable content for Microsoft Sentinel, including:

- **KQL queries and Analytics Rules** for hunting, detections, and troubleshooting.
- **Parsers and Functions** for parsing log tables and displaying in a more usable format.
- **Workbooks** for visualizing security data and metrics.
- **Logic Apps (Playbooks) and Function Apps** for incident response automation and integrations.

My goal is to share practical, production-tested content that others can quickly deploy and adapt to their Sentinel environments.
